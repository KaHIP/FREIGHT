FREIGHT is a streaming algorithm for hypergraph partitioning which is based on the widely-known graph-based algorithm Fennel.
By using an efficient data structure, we make the overall running of FREIGHT linearly dependent on the pin-count of the hypergraph and the memory consumption linearly dependent on the numbers of nets and blocks.
The results of our extensive experimentation showcase the promising performance of FREIGHT as a highly efficient and effective solution for streaming hypergraph partitioning. 
Our algorithm demonstrates competitive running time with the Hashing  algorithm, with a difference of a maximum factor of four observed on three fourths of the instances.
Significantly, our findings highlight the superiority of FREIGHT over all existing (buffered) streaming algorithms and even the in-memory algorithm HYPE, with respect to both cut-net and connectivity measures. 
This indicates that our proposed algorithm is a promising hypergraph partitioning tool to tackle the challenge posed by large-scale and dynamic data processing.

Repository Structure
-----------

This repository contains the following folders:

 - [code_for_hypergraphs/](code_for_hypergraphs/) - source code of FREIGHT
 - [code_for_graphs/](code_for_graphs/) - source code of a version of FREIGHT optimized for graphs
 - [experimental_results/](experimental_results/) - folder containing full experimental results reported in the paper


## Installation Notes

### Requirements

* C++-17 ready compiler 
* CMake 
* Scons (http://www.scons.org/)
* Argtable (http://argtable.sourceforge.net/)

### Building FREIGHT

To build the software, clone this repository, enter the intended code base and run
```shell
./compile.sh
```

Alternatively, you can use the standard CMake build process.

The resulting binary is located in the `deploy/` subdirectory within the appropriate code base.       
The executables *freight_cut* and *freight_con* optimize for cut-net and connectivity, respectively. 
For partitioning graphs, the corresponding executable is named *freight_graphs*.

## Running FREIGHT for hypergraphs

To partition a hypergraph in net-list format using FREIGHT, run

```shell
./freight_con <hypergraph filename> --k=<number of blocks> 
./freight_cut <hypergraph filename> --k=<number of blocks> 
```

For a complete list of parameters alongside with descriptions, run:

```shell
./freight_con --help
./freight_cut --help
```

For a characterization of the used hypergraph format, please see [this page](code_for_hypergraphs/examples/README.md).

## Running FREIGHT for graphs

To partition a graph in METIS format using FREIGHT, run

```shell
./freight_graphs <graph filename> --k=<number of blocks> 
```

For a complete list of parameters alongside with descriptions, run:

```shell
./freight_graphs --help
```

For a description of the graph format, please have a look at the [KaHiP manual](https://github.com/KaHIP/KaHIP/raw/master/manual/kahip.pdf).
